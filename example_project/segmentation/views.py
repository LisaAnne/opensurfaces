    Serve up a segmentation task.

    This is a demo, so we are going to hard-code an image to tag.
    In a live system, you would read the HIT id:
        hit_id = request.REQUEST['hitId']
        assignment_id = request.REQUEST['assignmentId']
    and fetch a photo from the database.

    When a user submits, the data will be in request.body.
    request.body will contain these extra fields corresponding
    to data sent by the task window:

        results: a dictionary mapping from the content.id (which is just "1" in
            this example) to a list of polygons.  Example:
            {"1": [[x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,...], [x1,y1,x2,y2,...]]}.
            The x and y coordinates are fractions of the width and height
            respectively.
        time_ms: amount of time the user spent (whether or not
            they were active)
        time_active_ms: amount of time that the user was
            active in the current window
        action_log: a JSON-encoded log of user actions
        screen_width: user screen width
        screen_height: user screen height
        version: always "1.0"

        If the user gives feedback, there will also be this:
        feedback: JSON encoded dictionary of the form:
        {
            'thoughts': user's response to "What did you think of this task?",
            'understand': user's response to "What parts didn't you understand?",
            'other': user's response to "Any other feedback, improvements, or suggestions?"
        }
